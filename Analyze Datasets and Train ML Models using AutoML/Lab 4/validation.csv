__label__0 "beautiful top marred only by the armholes . i tried a small and a medium but alas my bra showed under the arms . i my be overly endowed for this top but the way it cuts you would have to be braless to wear it . not for me but wish it worked . it is really pretty ."

__label__-1 "i might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all . a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small . for me it 's not true at all i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable but it was simply too short ( rather than 20 as it states on the website it 's more like 18 ) which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person ! i do n't even want to go regular size because it would 've been too big . i saw some photos that others po"
__label__-1 "i love the color patterns and fabric . it has full lining ! my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering ? a straight ( shift ) style would have been much better . dress runs large however the arm/shoulder area is tight ."
__label__1 "this is a very cute and unique cropped jacket . the attention to detail is excellent . i am normally a small but had to size down to an xs as the style is a bit boxy and to make it more fitted/tailored an xs looked better . i am 5 ' 5 118 lbs 34c slim athletic build . it is a chic alternative to a cardigan on a cooler day ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful top but it runs large . i am exchanging for one size smaller . it is worth the effort of exchanging ! well made beautiful lace ."

__label__-1 "this is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear . this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry . not worth the cost ."
__label__1 "i 'm trying to buy more basic versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that . definitely runs large -- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p . i 'm 5 ' 5 and the petite falls where it does on the model . the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like . quality seems ok for the sale price ."

__label__0 "what i liked : 1. midweight fabric . it 's not lined and when i read polyester in the description i was worried that it might be thin but this is a stretchy midweight fabric . 2. pretty pretty print what i did not like : 1. i do n't know what dress the model is wearing but this was an empire waist dress on me . i 'm 5 ' 7 . because it was empire waist the long hem makes this look like a maternity dress on me . 2. the sleeves are cut oddly . they look too wide for the dress even on this model . 3"
__label__0 "i really like the dress the material the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun . however the neckline is a bit to low and a cami is necessary at least for me . the material is very sheer which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee ) .the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off . there are no zippers or buttons . getting it on is easy not so when taking it off !"

__label__-1 "i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed . loved the skirt part of it . but the top which i guess i did n't see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides . would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool ."
__label__1 "i bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it 'll do just fine ! it 's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light but substantial enough that i do n't fear snagging it constantly . the cloth has a nice weight and drape and while the fit is on the loose side it does look intentional . wonderful as a pullover or by itself . i have the minty blue-green color and it 's divine . definitely worth the price ."
__label__0 "i have a love hate relationship with this product . it is comfortable and cozy yet unshapely . after the initial wear the product begins to stretch out and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand . the sherpa front is soft but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering . i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely but i would never leave the house with this on . i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too . i am typically a"

__label__1 "what can i say ? this is a winner ! it is stunning gorgeous a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet . it is classic early 1960s look which is exactly my style ! i am usually a 14 or a 16 so i went with a 16 based on the reviews and it fits divinely . i do n't need another orange dress but this is a keeper !"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful casual top ... it is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fit ... the length is perfect not too long or short ! the colors coordinate great with denim !"
__label__1 "so this shirt is very cute i like the drape ( if you can get it arranged properly ) but it is not black more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy . i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet . i am keeping it thinking i will wear it with leather since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different . i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine . a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker ."

__label__1 "i bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it was n't going to be delivered on time . i 'm so happy that i bought this dress . its so comfortable and easy to wear . i got lots of compliments on it . it runs very large though . i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10 as i have a larger chest . the 6 still had plenty of room ."

__label__1 "i ordered this top online . i had been wanting an off-the-shoulder top in a neutral color and when i found this one i had to have it ! i thought the price was great . when i received it i was impressed with the quality of material . it fit me a little more tightly than some of my other tops but was very satisfied with how it looked on my body ! i got it in a size small . i do agree with others on here the shoulders were a little more difficult to keep folded down ... but overall ... i am truly satisfi"
__label__0 "it was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom . the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt . i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it 's definitely not worth $ 60 ."

__label__-1 "definitely agree with the other reviewers . this top looks great on the model but pretty bad in real life . super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs . if you plan on ordering i 'd recommend sizing down ."

__label__1 "i tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them ! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino . great for hot days of summer . the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg . overall a really flattering cut . the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top ."

__label__1 "this sweater is very comfortable and soft . unlike other reviewer i did not find the lace to be itchy . i 'm 5 ' 4 usually size 6 ; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel . this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted . it 's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy . not sure how it 's going to handle the wash ."
__label__1 "this sweater is so lovely .. i like the fact that it 's not super heavy so you can be comfortable with a layer under it . the embroidery is beautiful . i usually get petite sizes when available but the petite m was sold out when i purchased . i went with regular medium and am actually glad . it 's not overwhelming or too long ( i 'm 5 ' 2 ) .. in my opinion . if you 're on the fence go for it . totally worth it .."

__label__1 "i have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store . it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it ! i absolutely love the fit -- it 's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality . i 'm typically a medium sometimes large -- i bought the medium and it 's perfect . i could have gone down to a small as well . the large was way too big ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 8 athletic 150lbs ) . this top is going to take me everywhere this summer ! worth a try !"
__label__0 "this dress is adorable . the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer . the cotton is also nice and light . however the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips . if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you ."
__label__1 "i tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it . the picture does not do it justice . it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality . fabric is very soft and light weight . highly recommend !"

__label__0 "the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it 's on backwards.the lace would be nice but it 's itchy . and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body . the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky . just could n't get it to work ."
__label__-1 "there 's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views . it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse . the print is lovely but the fit is very odd . it 's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too . i wear medium or large and ordered size large . if you 're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you . but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide . returned ."
__label__1 "this is truly the best black dress ... you can wear to sooo many things . a long time keeper for the closet . i felt it ran a little bit big ... i am normally an 8-10 ... i bought both sizes ( 8 and 10 ) ... kept the 8 ... but felt i could even get away with a 6 ... but did n't want to pay shipping again for another size . i am 5 ' 7 and 155lbs . it is truly a flattering dress for any figure ."

__label__0 "bought this in the white . i found it to run narrow in the shoulders and tight in the biceps . i typically vacillate between a m and l and because of the two aforementioned factors i went with the large which means overall the shirt is very billowy on me in the chest area and hangs very long . -- -- -- -- -- the fabric is soft and the weight of this shirt is season-less ; always a plus . it is not sheer by any means but if you have a tattoo ( like i do ) you will be able to see it . -- -- -- -- - quality is"

__label__0 "i think this dress is very pretty and i like that it 's made of silk . i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy . what i do n't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress . the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back ( you can see similar in the model shot from behind ) . for the price i was expecting a little more quality control . i also do not care for the lining . i do not think the off white is"
__label__1 "i am always looking for a shirt that 's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt ( running after a 1 year old i need comfort ) . i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple ( which i think it said was blue for some reason ) . the material is nice and the cut is feminine ."
__label__-1 "i was expecting a lot more but this was disappointing . the material is thin and the quality is n't great . it also hung loose just too loose as it runs very very large i returned it"
__label__1 "im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great . very slimming and looks great with white capris ."

__label__-1 "this dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah . i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same . not cute not flattering the model photo is deceiving . would not recommend although it looks airy and comfy ."
__label__-1 "i was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable . however while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist . i will acknowledge i 'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs but was hopeful these pants would n't cling to them . for reference i 'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants ."

__label__1 "this top is my new favorite . i ordered it on a whim and oh boy am i glad ! ! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me and once it arrived i could n't wait to put it . once i put it on i could n't wait to show it off ! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings shorts and sandals . such an easy classic simple shirt that i will probably wear too much ."
__label__0 "hangs terribly off the chest . tent-like . looks maternity . no thanks ."
__label__0 "i really like the pattern and the cut of these pants . the fabric is nice too . however i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first ( and only ) time i wore them . i am 5 ' 6 and about 150 lbs . i ordered size 10 ; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much ."
__label__-1 "was very surprised when i opened the package this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through . the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all . i have a short waist length so it should have worked . the color is a little darker than pictured but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced . going back asap ."
__label__0 "i usually wear an 8 which was n't available and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it 's a set-in waist band . the fabric is pretty the skirt is fully lined the length is not too short and the only thing i do n't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version but on the black it stands out . it 's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays ."
__label__-1 "after trying several sizes including petite and regular i am sad to return this dress . the regular sizes were too long on me ( i am 5 ' 4 ) and although the petite fit me just a little short the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me . i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just could n't get the fit . usually i have great luck with cloth & stone ."
__label__0 "this dress is tricky . the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small . i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath . the fabric is a very thin linen . my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro . its very light and cool perfect for the summer time ."
__label__0 "i tried this on at the store and though it was pretty i was a little underwhelmed . it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up . the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking . the idea of the top was better than the execution ."
__label__0 "i kept this top only because i needed a plain black tank but there is nothing special about it . i found it a bit large and thin cheap material ."
__label__0 "they are beautiful in person until you put the on . the fit was a bit weird ; tighter in the waist roomy in the crotch . the fabrics work 100 % against one another . the vegan leather especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams is too stiff . the back is thin and has far too much elasticity . at $ 150 i passed . these will only enter my closet on sale ."
__label__-1 "i also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it . i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it . the fabric is made of cheap poly that 's shiny thin and clingy . it shows every lump and bump you have . the zipper at the back wo n't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump . the sewing and hemline is uneven . there was n't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline"
__label__-1 "this blouse has too much drapey fabric and it 's just not flattering . in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit . sending back ."
__label__-1 "too tight in strange ways . beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it however it just did not fit ."
__label__-1 "the shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on . sent it back . would n't buy even on sale ."
__label__-1 "totally bummed . the pretty print does n't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress . makes you look really top heavy and even the print which looks so cute online looks muddled in person . sadly went right back ."
__label__1 "beautiful sweater ! ! i love the color and the fit . the cowl neck is n't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy . it comes down to the low hip on me . very soft and cozy . i purchased the aqua in xs . fits perfectly and i 'm 5 5 ' 127lbs ."
__label__-1 "i was not a fan of these leggings . these were very unflattering . i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out . i just did n't feel like they would hold up for even one season ."
__label__0 "in the photo of the dress you might have a hard time telling that the top half of the dress is the lace part and is a stretchy knit fabric while the bottom half is polyester and not stretchy at all . fyi : 36c ( 34d ) short waist broad shoulders/back usually a 10/12 in a fitted top/dress the navy lace of the top as i said is knit . therefore it was too stretchy and the straps actually were already too long . it was so loose that i needed the smaller size in the top half of the dress ( 10 ) ."
__label__-1 "if you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest this is the one for you . i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition but this one did not do it for me . i can not imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy ."
__label__1 "this was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on . love it ! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way . colors are great . got the petite size . the pattern is different for each one so each is unique . mine has . lot more navy blue ."
__label__0 "i received this dress today for a june wedding . i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it . it runs very big . i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides . bummer : ("

__label__0 "according to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10 but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage the one spot i do n't keep any fat . i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12 but i could n't breath with the 12 on . for reference i am 34ddd . it was the 34 part that did n't fit the ddd would have fit fine i think ."
__label__0 "i wish this fit more to the body it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it . the mustard color is beautiful so is the pink ( i ordered both to compare ) . but the 00 was still big on me ( and p ) . so i passed . fabric is light for summer so if you are thin not muscular perhaps that would look great ?"
__label__0 "i found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline ; however the fabric feels cheap and does n't drape as nicely as i 'd hope for the price . this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric . for sizing reference i 'm 5 ' 5 `` 122 lbs 30dd and took my usual size xs - though i 'm busty for my size the top provides nice coverage ."
__label__-1 "i tried wearing it however i thought i needed courage to wear this tank . unfortunately i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design . first it runs small than the regular size . it feels even smaller because my size is xs . in addition it tends to exaggerate a body line . i am not quite sure why this happens but maybe it is just the way this tank is . if you are confident about your upper body posture then yes it would look very cool . however if you have thin postur"
__label__0 "this shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free . i also love that it 's the perfect weight and not too low cut and that the buttons are covered . however the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it ! i did n't even wash the shirt yet . sadly i do n't think i can recommend this shirt though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one . oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body but it still looks great . i hope this helps !"
__label__-1 "this top has a nice design . i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape . if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist . however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank . it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area which i could have easily fixed . it is very sheer ; even with a nude bra my bra was too visible for my comfort . plan on wearing a full camisole underneath tank or bralette you are fine with being on display ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks nothing like the photo . the sequins are dull no sheen at all . the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap shiny plastic . i did n't even try it on because it was so hideous when i pulled it out of the box . not remotely worth the price and would n't buy it on sale for $ 20 either . skip ."
__label__0 "i 'm 4'10 and 105lbs .. 32c and hippy ... i ordered the 00p and 0p .. bc i 'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay .. could n't justify the price . it 's a beautiful dress in the green color . the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break .. but if it fit i would 've overlooked it .. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it ... i would 've had to have it sewn shut ."
__label__1 "saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo . tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me - i 'm a 34 dd 5 ft 4 and the regular size 10 fit fine . i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher but none were available . still the regular 10 works well . excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami . seems very ve"
__label__1 "i was n't sure how the knotted front would look on me but it lays perfectly . very comfortable well-designed flattering top in lovely rich colors . i 'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops but i got the large as it does run small and i do n't like things too clingy . so best to try on in store rather than buy online . nice simple statement piece !"
__label__0 "i am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit . if you 're a true xs i 'd skip this one . however if you are able to size down i think it would look really great !"
__label__0 "i 'm not much for ponchos but this one looked unique . it is thin kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online and it was wide horizontally . the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic . the turtleneck was thick and itchy . it was a return ."
__label__1 "this an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it . i 'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material . i would n't want to discourage anyone from trying it ."

__label__1 "adorable ! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit . i 'm sure i 'll wear this with jeans as pictured but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt ."
__label__-1 "i disliked this dress . it did n't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured . i think it would work well for tall thin women with a smaller chest . i am petite with a larger chest and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time . not recommended for petite women ."

__label__0 "this dress is very pretty and we 'll made . it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down ."
__label__0 "i was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality . the quality of the material is not very good . i 've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they 're very soft and very well made hence my disappointment . i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress ."
__label__0 "overall it 's a beautiful dress and i really wanted it to work . but the material feels cheap ( at least not what you 'd expect for the price ) and as other reviewers have mentioned it 's just a tad too short . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 125 lbs and the 2 fit well but hung well above my knees . there 's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people . sadly this dress will be returned ."

__label__0 "but-the problem is i can not get the color to stay below the shoulders . the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that did n't lay right . if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me . i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i ca n't get the desired look to work out so this is going back ."

__label__-1 "i am so sad i have to return these leggings . they 're adorable -- so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them -- but as other reviewers have pointed out there 's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they 'll fall down ! why sleeping on snow ? whyyyyyyyyyyy ? they 're so great otherwise !"

__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."

( i love browsing the retailer store its a feast for my senses ) the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern . to me the burned orange feels like country and fall the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer . they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this"

__label__0 "this is as pretty in person as it is online good quality ( except one item i 'll get to ) and fits true to size . i 'm 5 ' 6 normally a medium/8 and the medium fit great in this top . i almost kept this shirt ... so close i had it on a hanger but i kept trying it on . the shirt is well displayed in the pics online but unless you get close it 's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide . every time i put it on my eyes went to the top button ( i did get a second opinion and they agreed ) ..."
__label__0 "this is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape . fairly cute fit but not as a layering piece ."
__label__-1 "this looks cute on the model but was way too big loose and sloppy for me . i probably needed a petite size . i ordered a regular xs but returned it . it is an okay black top nothing great ."
__label__-1 "appears much more sleek in the photograph . in real life this shirt looks more like a pajama top . thin extremely casual not worth the price i paid- even in black . will be exchanging it tomorrow ."
__label__0 "i was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i 'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is . i returned it ."
__label__0 "fit and style very nice . returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming . they were at least 4 too long . i am 5 ' 8 so heels would fix the issue but i do n't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants ."

__label__-1 "beware . white is not white . white is more cream off-white light beige . i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color . they are cute but not white . i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer but unfortunately creamy colored shorts do n't do much for navy/white tops.also the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok ."
__label__0 "i love the style of this top and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts . it 's somewhat fitted on the top yet it 's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom . the ruffled v-neckline is pretty and i like the longer length of the short sleeves . but with all these attributes unfortunately they cut the armholes really big so when you put your arms forward the sleeves pull against your arms . i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway but for $ 98 dollars i thin"
__label__-1 "this skirt looks and feels cheap and the color is much more green than pictured . additionally i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds and this is still way too tight to be flattering ."
__label__1 "i was on the fence about this dress - i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation . i 'm glad i took the chance once it went on sale ! the fabric is not as thick as you 'd expect for a sweater . just thick enough to hide any imperfections panty lines etc . i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket . i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneck . i 'm 5 ' 6 ' 135 lbs 34b and the small fit perfectly . i am pear - shaped by conventional standards bu"
__label__1 "this is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow . this sweater 's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky . wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments ."
__label__-1 "this dress is just very unattractive . it is quite short-waisted almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place . also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide . the effect is matronly not cute at all . size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good ."
__label__1 "i ordered this online but i own the vest and i love it so i took a chance . this is a super comfy great quality jacket . the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive . the color i ordered the green is perfect . i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking . they look exactly like the picture so if you do n't mind that you will probably be very happy with this jacket . it just was n't for me . i ended"

__label__0 "i wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me which is surprising . they also do n't lay really flat in the back . the pockets are inside in the back in side two layers and do n't lay very flat . the crotch is low and rides up when i walk . i 'll probably wear them again but i 'm not totally thrilled by them ."

__label__0 "pretty top online - okay in person . runs small especially on bottom hemline . thought it would have a swing to it . it does not . more sheer in person than i thought it would be . that would n't stop me from keeping it though . it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering . looked like i was wearing a bib . i do n't have a large chest just weird look on me . unfortunate because it is an adorable print . top made for thinner or a petite lady ."
__label__1 "i ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner . i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height . i was for sure it would be too short in any other size . when i put it on i was drowning in it ! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal . has the potential to be super cute and flattering yet the timing and sizing did n't work out . definitely give this one a try !"
__label__0 "the top is really cute but it 's see through and the material does n't seem like the highest quality . definitely not worth the price ."
__label__0 "after reading other reviews i ordered a small . my usual size is a m. it was huge all around . it 's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top ."
__label__1 "i love this fabric it is comfortable and forgiving . as i prefer jewel tone colors the sapphire is great . i wish it would be offered in red like the cowl neck long sleeve tee . with that said i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd and while i wish it were a few inches longer ( 3/4 sleeved ) . the only reason i have n't given it five stars is that i have n't laundered it enough to verify the quality ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a small petite and medium petite and i am a huge fan of a * k. i put tried on the sp . while it fit it was very long even for a petite . what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide . even a long necklace would n't help deter the look . on a positive side the blue was a very nice cool color . i am usually a small to medium in a * k ( 6-8 in tops ) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice just too much fabric for me . returning !"

__label__1 "this blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack .. living in l.a. it 's 90 degrees one day and 60 the next . the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate . it runs true to size and is very comfy . thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner ."
__label__-1 "this is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on . fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms shoulder chest ... then the waist was huge ! just hung off of me like a flour sack . it was wider than the chest measurements which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic . combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject . sent back immediately do not buy this if you have ( or want to appear to have ) an hourglass figure it will do nothing for"
__label__0 "loved the look of this top . sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not . the item ran out of stock far too quickly . i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock . the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest . length is great for taller women ."
__label__-1 "it 's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts . ordered an xl and the top part would not button . i recommend for those with smaller busts ."
__label__0 "beautiful thick sturdy denim . probably the best denim i own in terms of the material . the cut can be awkward as it can be tight across the thighs and hips and kinda makes my butt flat . however i love the wash and quality of the material and at a sales price totally worth it ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and it was huge . i could n't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i do n't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either . definitely not worth the price ."
__label__1 "i tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that 's what i am . i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it would n't really look right but omg it 's 100 % amazing and flattering . wear it with skinny jeans leggings jeggings whatever and it 's just super awesome on dressed up or down . i 'd buy this over and over again without a doubt ."
__label__0 "i love the design of this sweater and ordered it online but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived . also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo still a type of ivory but a little yellow-y . the sweater was solid looking but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i 'm not sure how well it would have worn over time . flattering cut . i liked how it fit but for the price and fabric i decided to return it . unfortunate to lose money on shipping ."
__label__-1 "nice quality fabric and design but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange . wanted to love it but sadly sent it back"
__label__-1 "i adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer . picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day . i feel as if i wasted my money ."
__label__1 "the picture does n't do these justice ! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights . i am 5 ' 2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long . so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly ! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band . ( not styled like the pic ) . they literally feel like you are wearing nothing . you 'll receive so many compliments - trust me !"
__label__0 "i loved this when i got it . it has such a flattering fit ! slightly loose in the body but not flowy . nice weight of fabric . comfortable fabric . perfect scoop neck that does n't show too much cleavage . but i washed it once on delicate and line dried ( which i do with most of my shirts ) and it came out riddled in holes ."
__label__-1 "the cut of the top portion of the dress is off . i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area . i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up . for reference i am a 34b . i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it was n't for said flaw ."
__label__1 "i wish i could buy this is more colors ! so easy to dress up or dress down"
__label__1 "these jeans are perfect in every way . i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos . they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them . i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on . they look great - highly recommend ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in a size 8 my normal size at retailer . it is a lovely dress and so feminine but it is incorrectly sized . i could n't begin to button it . i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything . buyer beware . unless you are itsy bitsy you need to size up . i will say that as pretty as the photos are the dress is even more lovely in person ."
__label__1 "i was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking . per other reviews i took a chance ... i love it ! so sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enough ... but still casual and fun . detail work is very nicely done ."
__label__0 "i 'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it . a smaller size would work better . it 's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size is n't flattering . an xsmall for me"
__label__1 "runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small ."

__label__0 "i really wanted to like this dress . i am 5 ' 3 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long . the hem created a puddle around my feet . i 've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem . sadly it went back to the store ."
__label__1 "this skirt is so cute . the fix print is really nice . it 's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe ."
__label__-1 "the quality is good as is the design idea but practically it does n't work . ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly . this top is not soft or flowy it is stiff and very wide ."
__label__1 "this t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything . my only concern is the fabric is super light . not enough to be see through but just enough to make me question the quality . i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though . the drape is nice and not super revealing ; discreet enough for work . i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile ."
__label__-1 "material is strange . triangle top is funky . this is just not awesome in any way ."
__label__-1 "i purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved it 's nautical theme pattern . when i recurve do the dress i found it to be stiff and boxy . being a petite short-waisted person the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly . my bra strap was showing in the back and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame . i returned the dress"
__label__1 "i bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom . absolutely loved it ! i am 52 so the dress is part is a bit long for me -- -ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit . the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures . but that makes it more formal . it 's great !"
__label__1 "love this dress . the fit is amazing . i wore it to church for my brother 's wedding and got so many compliments . it looks great in photos too !"
__label__1 "this sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up but it 's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable warm and wintry at the same time . it does run true to size i ordered a small ( 5 ' 5 and 118 lbs ) . knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season ! ! !"
__label__0 "i have been looking for a basic ivory sweater . i waited for this one to go on sale . the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy . unfortunately i decided to return it ."
__label__0 "usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me ! and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work . i 'm a 34d and it was way too small in the chest area . it is a beautiful shirt though and i 'm very sad that i have to return it . it will work better on someone else for sure . so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine !"
__label__1 "i love camisoles like this and retailer always has great ones ! it has a nice length so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan . it 's fitted but not tight ."
__label__-1 "i loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape i was frustrated that it did n't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head . the fabric was stiff and seemed to be lace over cotton ? not entirely sure . i could n't get past the feeling off the material ."
__label__1 "cute shirt it looked big so i ordered a size smaller . worked fine . would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down . ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back . fun shirt though !"
__label__1 "i absolutely love these pants ! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now . i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric . well these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft . i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy . i love"
__label__1 "i ordered the ivory in size xl . it is such a cute comfortable top . all of the details are well-done . the quality of the material is great too . it 's a flowy fit . after washing & air-drying it does shrink a bit . great tee for summer !"
__label__-1 "this blouse is so beautiful - the collar sleeves material ... everything except the cut ! it was like a tent . it needed to be more tapered which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow and be about two inches longer . i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed ! please fix it and then i will buy again . i am 5 ' 4 140lbs and busty ... a small was perfect with the exception of the massive amount of material ."
__label__-1 "the skirt is comfortable and as pictured . it also ran tts . i 'm 5 ' 5 tall and weigh 140 lbs . i had the medium and did n't need to size up to a large . when you put the skirt on a normal body it looks like you are wearing an easter egg ... and not in a good way ."
__label__0 "beautiful dress but it just did n't look that flattering on me . the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture . unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it . the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off i definitely do n't !"
__label__1 "this top is super cute . the color is beautiful and the lace detail is very feminine . im a 36c and got the size small . it fits great ."
__label__-1 "i had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color . it was also more boxy than i thought it would be . i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit ."
__label__0 "i was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog but disappointed when it got to stores . the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store . i 'd say it even looks a bit purple . the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really do n't like the color . i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning ."
__label__1 "i had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited ! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body . i love the bottom of it it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back . add an ada wrap belt and perfection !"
__label__-1 "like other reviewers have said this item runs extremely long and large . i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide -- much wider than any standard wide leg pant i 've owned . sadly had to return ."
__label__-1 "i was surprised by the other reviews . expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward . the hi-low cut with so much bulk just was n't flattering . i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body . the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more . it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i 'd hoped . it went back ."
__label__1 "highly recommend these jeans ! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream . the wash is flattering on them as well . i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these . they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size ."
__label__1 "i started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own ! this one is no exception . i bought it in black last week ( size s ) for my birthday treat and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district . it 's feminine and delicate in appearance yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable . it 's awesome just a perfect summer and probably fall dress ."
__label__-1 "loved the look of this shirt online . i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong . the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated ( almost looks as if i 'm ready for take off ! ) . unfortunately none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model . i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it ! looks great from the side but sadly i ca n't walk around like that ; )"
__label__0 "cute pants not for me . a petite size may have changed my mind . more like ankle pants on my 5 ' 2 frame and a bit large all over . that said the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable . love the snaps on the waistband classy casual ."
__label__-1 "so much extra fabric . not something i would recommend buying online ."
__label__1 "this is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised ! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt . the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer . though it is kind of a dark navy i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern . for my sister 's graduation i paired it with a white"
__label__1 "very comfortable and cute . i had fallen in love with this in the catalog and when i saw it in the store i was disappointed . however after trying it on i had to have it . very flattering and comfortable ."

__label__0 "i purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black . the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything . i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it 's thin and see through . if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it !"
__label__1 "i buy everything that retailer sells in chambray . this top did not disappoint . it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing . the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying . i am not big busted so i did n't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have ."
__label__1 "love the length and long sleeves . so comfy to sleep in ! great purchase i ordered the navy one too ! !"
__label__-1 "this blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off . just odd . sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received . mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white . no ruffle . returned ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to find this dress in the store ! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on .... what a disappointment . the fabric is stunning but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium so i grabbed a small ...... the only way to describe this dress is tentlike ! it was huge from the waist down . i do n't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect ! i was sad to leave the store without this dress ."
__label__1 "bought these over the weekend and i am in love ! they are very soft extremely flattering and the rich green color is fantastic . i may go back for the black . i went with my usual size 28 for reference and the fit is great . these will be a fall staple for sure !"
__label__-1 "i do n't typically write bad reviews but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it . i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway ( my fault i know ) . the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes ) . i 'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust ( i ordered both sizes to try ) . i would n't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small"
__label__-1 "pretty fabric nice style took it back ."
__label__0 "dress cut was great but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age ."
__label__1 "i was n't sure how to rate the fit on these . i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there 's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area . i tried a 10 but the waist did n't fit . i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print . there is no stretch in these either . i have slim legs- if you do n't i would size up or just pass . the calf is tight ."
__label__0 "this dress has way too much material . the material is really soft and beautiful but there 's too much of it . it feels like you 're wearing a big sack . sadly i 'll be returning it ."
__label__1 "i ordered the white in this . i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos . i do n't think they do this piece justice . i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered . i found it fit true to size . love the three ties in the back . it 's a tad baggy but looks great . i can see that this might snag easily though ."
__label__-1 "fits large wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price ."
__label__1 "love these pilcro jeans my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans . i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs they are not supposed to be leggings . they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist not enough to size down . the dark color is perfect for winter ! they are very comfortable ! ! love pilcro jeans !"
__label__0 "i love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too flowy ."
__label__0 "i ended up returning it just because it did n't do much for my current postnatal figure but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique !"
__label__-1 "the picture makes the shorts look structured . i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material . i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester . also this runs way too big . i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs . i would n't even buy this at the sale price ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews . it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant . i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big ....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet ."

__label__1 "i fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it . unfort they were out of the s so i went with a medium . fortunately for me this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large i will still keep it . the material is sturdy and of good quality the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy . great piece !"
__label__-1 "i bought this suit based on the great reviews . i was so bummed when i tried it on . the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up . my torso is on the longer side so maybe that 's why the bottoms keep coming up . every time i pulled the shorts down the top would come down too and vice versa . i am 5 ' 5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size . i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that 's the extent of what i liked about it . i will be returning it ."

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress it looks beautiful on the model but it is n't the flattering even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it it it runs pretty big ."
__label__-1 "bought this shirt on-line . wanted to love it but just could n't . i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style .... just did n't have enough shape . had to send it back ."

__label__-1 "much lower quality than other robes i have purchased"
__label__-1 "this skirt is definitely not what i was expecting . the material is stiff and rough . the skirt is also loud . you can hear it swishing when you move and not in a classy way . it feels like you 're wearing a very long tutu . also the pattern is n't quite as pretty in person . they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow ."
__label__0 "i was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party . i 'm 5 ' 4 36c 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me . i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress ( which is a sweater-like material ) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering ; the petite may have fixed it but then the skirt would 've been too short . the pleats were cute but flared out too"

__label__0 "i am returning . i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua but the biggest problem for me is the shape . it 's pretty boxy and it 's hard to tell from the photo but it has a batwing shape . i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory ( less yellow in it ) but that 's based on what looks better against my skin tone . i found it to run true to size but i thought it was unflattering ( made me look wide ) ."
__label__-1 "ugh the fit of this dress is terrible : / what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential . but the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok if not a tad big but hip down was crazy tight that i could n't even zip it without a ton of effort . i do n't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger . disappointing ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! it 's super comfortable and can easily be dressed down with a jean jacket and some sandals or dressed up with leather and a good pair of heels . the fit is spot on and very slimming and i like that the length is n't too short as well ."
__label__-1 "this is a cute top but it runs pretty big . order a size down . the material is like a thick gauze almost so i 'd definitely wear a tank under ."
__label__1 "i could live in this top : it 's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer ; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything ; and it 's comfortable enough to wear around the clock . note that it runs small . i had to size up to a medium even though 80 % of everything else i wear is size small ."
__label__-1 "love this dress ! wore it last night for a musical event ... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water ... just as the label states . pulled the dress out and guess what ? the design is completely faded ! ! ! it looks 5 years old : ( so sad . i 'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund ( i live two hours away )"

__label__0 "i really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly ca n't now . i was attracted to the softness simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it . wrinkles pills and loses shape quickly . if you still want to get it consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you . this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size . the styling is excellent -- very versatile . but the yarn is too delicate and fussy ."
__label__-1 "the fabric is a little stiff the back looks unusually long compared to the front and it fits tight across the chest . and i 'm not busty so that 's not a factor ."

__label__-1 "not as cute as photos and too small in chest . i am 5 ' 5 `` 125 lbs and the small was too tight in the chest and i am not large here at all . shoulders and sleeve length fit well . will return . not comfortable and will need to be able to button it on rainy days ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress before putting it on but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type . it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for . sadly this will be going back . i loved the print and the feel of the material . just not a flattering cut for me ."
__label__-1 "this top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry . the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity . the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more . buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things ."
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me . it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders however i 'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me . the quality is nice . it is medium in weight . it has a cottony feeling but it not super soft . it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me . i wanted to love it but i only just like it . i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun loose look in a sweater ."
__label__-1 "wow ! this sure is close fitting as in suction cups to your body ! yikes definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves . to me it seems like the material will wear well . i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it not sure . it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs it wo n't work . i ordered the medium and am usually a small . the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy . i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas ."

__label__1 "gorgeous dress . perfect for something special . paired with black heels . runs a touch large . i normally wear a small ( 5 ' 6 and 140 pounds ) but i 'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it 's very roomy . the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it 's just so pretty i do n't care ! def a keeper ."

__label__0 "ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off . i love the drape in the front but it did not hit in the right place . the fabric was soft but not as high end looking as i was expecting . i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look but sadly this is going back ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this because the reviews were outstanding . i am returning it . although the embroidery looks fine on screen in person it looks cheap and tacky . moreover the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy . overpriced to boot . obviously mine is a minority opinion ."

__label__1 "i knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable beautiful fabric cute gold buttons ! as well due to the cut it feels roomy but has a slender fit around the arms . the denim color has beautiful detail but i do n't think i would like the maroon solid . i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one !"
__label__0 "kinda a boxy looking sweater . it definitely made me look really large and just could n't see myself wearing it very often . ended up returning it ."
__label__0 "i love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits ."
__label__0 "the sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body . i like the fabric ( nice and thick ) but it did not work for me ."
__label__1 "it is a little boxy but it ? s not unflattering in my opinion . the sweatshirt material is soft the ruffles keep their shape and position and aren ? t too overwhelming on my small frame . i like the small slits on the sides they allow the sweater to drape nicely . it also hit at a flattering spot a little below the hip . 5 ? 1 ? ? 100 lbs and got the xxs petite . this fit true to size for me ."
__label__-1 "so you 're thinking this is a red and black skirt right ? nope . it 's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex . spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line . it 's really god awful ."
__label__1 "amazingly soft thin and super warm ! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny !"
__label__-1 "granted that i am not as reed thin or as young as the model . but i am tall and reasonably slender . i have long hands and small wrists which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment . this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you 'd keep in the car for emergency purposes in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose . i was looking for a statement"
__label__-1 "i really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just is n't for me . the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable . the fit is not quite right on me . the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt . i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not . it was not very comfortable for me either so this was clearly not a win for me ."
__label__1 "i was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package it was a wrinkled mess lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack . however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love . it draped beautiful the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled . i feel iike i will use for many seasons ."
__label__1 "this is a great little top . the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts . the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching . i received several compliments when i wore it ."
__label__0 "bought this in the store and fell in love with it . very soft and flattering to wear . however after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill . this truly is a beautiful sweater but i fear it will not be beautiful for long . i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress and after i got it on . as others mentioned it is difficult to get it on . i wish that the bow snapped on and off . as i took the dress off the bow came off itself . unfortunately going to be returning the dress ."

__label__-1 "if you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you . beyond unflattering . boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade"
__label__-1 "this is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it 's not going to work . too boxy . too short . and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child 's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine ."
__label__-1 "this sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest . it 's very well made but not for the curvy girl . this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others ' reviews before i purchase ."

__label__-1 "well the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time . i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons . fits like tent long huge make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target ."
__label__1 "love love the print on these but the fit is off . i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear . i ca n't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable . rare for hei hei to fit wonky ."
__label__1 "i love love these wide leg pants ! the embroidery detail give them a little something extra special . they are comfortable and perfect . the length is great for wedges and the fold over waist does not add bulk . the only downside and this is probably due to my figure but the pockets do need to be sewn shut so that they will lie flat ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off . i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots . when i took it out of the package i could tell it looked really small . i did n't even try it on . i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on and she could n't even get it over her hips . if you are tall and thin like the model it will work for you . it is made of cupro looks exactly like the photo the color is g"
__label__1 "beautiful dress but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist . it runs huge : i 'm 5 ' 6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best . there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist . i received a lot of compliments on this dress ! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes ."
__label__1 "okay this is the cutest sleep jumper i 've ever owned . it 's soft and cozy and even a tiny bit sexy . i give it 4 stars because it 's a little on the thin side ; not sheer but close . really fun little piece . definitely recommend ."
__label__1 "true to size very pretty . as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light . i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this shirt . the fit was great and the fabric just felt beautiful . luxurious soft and flowing . but the collar was frayed ... in addition the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship . i put it aside to return it then this morning went to have another look at it wanting to talk myself back into it . but i ca n't overlook the fact i 'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn . it may be only this"
__label__0 "i got the black in a medium . it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy . i think it 's the angled wide sides . on me the design just created bulk . nice substantial fabric but it is n't soft or cozy . back it goes"

__label__-1 "this dress is absolutely hideous on my physique . ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent . i have an athletic built am a 34d . it is going back asap ."
__label__-1 "i loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available . unfortunately i was disappointed on arrival . besides being more muted color-wise the sizing is way off . i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me . on the model it looks like it skims the body when in reality it falls like a tent . i tried tucking it into a skirt but there was just too much fabric . though the neck worked for me i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow . also it"
__label__1 "i always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints i think it 's a lot of fun . not so fun to put on but it 's worth the trouble . i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself . i also own the mona dress in 8p but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much ."
__label__1 "these got me so excited for fall . the teal is a color i 'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these . when they arrived though i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch . the fit is snug but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable ! these will be a staple in my wardrobe . i want to order more colors !"

__label__-1 "i am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes ! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips ... but for those of us with curves ( i 'm a size 12 hourglass ) these are very unflattering . they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds just around the hips ! so bummed because they look so cute on the model ."
__label__-1 "the bottom part of this romper is easy to put on but the top is very poorly designed . it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back . you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear . once i got it on it fit perfectly though . getting out of it was a disaster . i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip . overall i was crushed that it did n't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering ."
__label__-1 "this may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried . the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo absolutely garish . the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties it just looks cheap . the skirt is an antebellum nightmare . i did not even want to try it on it 's that bad . i considered adding a photo but was too horrified . for reference i 'm 5'10 approximately the height/ size of the model but it was shorter than the photo depictes . i wanted to like it"
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this . i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock . i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer . unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange . it cut my off in the most unflattering spot ."
__label__1 "the photo does n't do it justice . the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans . texture is light and gauze-y but i do n't find it too see-though . sizing was tough- i 'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s and went with the xs on this ( ordered both to try ) sacrificing some length for a more flattering width . great for the sale price ! ! !"
__label__1 "very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navy/black instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times ( cardigan tights etc ) difficult ."
__label__0 "i love the material of this shirt and i love the design ; however there is just too much fabric . it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all . for someone who is petite this just was n't flattering . i love the design idea though !"
__label__-1 "after seeing this on anthto 's facebook page i was so excited to order . i ended up going to a store and trying on . i could n't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it . i thought this ran quite big . and the shape was odd . lots of material in the middle . i am a mom of 3 young kids and did n't want people to think # 4 was on the way ."
__label__0 "those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast . this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture . also the material is quite thin which makes the snug part look unflattering . they were not for me unfortunately ."
__label__-1 "i brought this shirt for a vacation it fitted well and was flattering . totally a comfortable wear however after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom . i am hoping i can return it . not worth the money ."

__label__-1 "this is a beautiful shirt . the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect . the only thing that i did n't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are . i was taking this shirt off and one popped off . when i went to hang it another one popped off ! so i had to return it . such a shame ."
__label__1 "this dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it . i love absolutely anything with a full shape and this dress has it ! its cut like a circle ... so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric . i 'm 5 ' 8 and would n't be able to wear it as a dress but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings . the arms are a tad more fitted ( though i have larger arms ) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine . if you love a cool quirky piece this one is a winner !"

__label__0 "the fit on these is good for my hourglass shape and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too . i bought . a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these . i am going to return these and see if they have something better but will only buy in store from now on ."
__label__1 "nice top ; the material is soft and drapey . i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket ."
__label__-1 "the shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering . the back felt bulky and looked awkward . definitely returning ."
__label__0 "i thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks but it 's completely see through . i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok but it 's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to . if the fabric was a little thicker this would be the perfect tank . unless your planning on layering this i would n't recommend ."
__label__-1 "i 'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online so when it went on sale i ordered it right away . well i was thoroughly disappointed . i agree with some of the other reviewers the fit is odd huge on top and too snug on the bottom . being made of flimsy silk it has no give and did n't hang well on my curvy body being too loose in some areas and too snug in others . also the top is embroidered while the bottom is n't . the material is thin and and it definitely is n't high enoug"
__label__0 "unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re : dry cleaning only but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker . it did fit well -- i am 5 ' 2 32c 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well definitely form-fitting not long in the arms or waist . the grey heather design was not my favorite look actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest and it looked like i had a huge dark stain ."
__label__0 "i ordered a six 6 petite . the pant leg was still very long . and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare . this is a slim fit . i have heavy thighs and this was not for me . i 'm 5 ' 120 lbs . also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing . which i do n't get because it 's spandex blend . also was n't too hip in the zipper on the back ."
__label__0 "nice dress you can wash it i got black in med . i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design . i wish it would be lighter material . material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress . probably will stretch when you sit in car driving . i will be returning it for that reason too heavy for summer ."
__label__1 "this blouse is so pretty ! i love the design the material and the pattern is so unique . i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist . i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less . the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling . i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints ! ! ! i adore it and feel so good wearing it ! if i could change anything i 'd m"
